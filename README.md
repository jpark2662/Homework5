# This file describes the work done on the rProject adn r markdown/HTML file for MSDS 6306 Homework5

#  The actual assignment may be viewed in this repo and is called 'Assignment05'.

#  There are two input data sets.  yob2015.csv and yob2016.csv

#  The r markdown file (hw5.RMD) and associated R code (HW5.RProj) cleans the data of mispellings, merges to create a most popular list of names for the combined years in both files.

#  The code does this for Male and Female names for those in both years.

#  Finally the code creates a file, also found in the repo, called itsagirl.csv

#  itsagirl.csv is a list of the 10 most popular girl names for the combined 2015 and 2016 data.

#  There is also an HTML file called HW5.HTML which is the cleaned up output of the r markdwon file.

#  For Reference there is also a basic codebook describing the objects used in the R code.
